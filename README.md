##General idea
This Python project uses Azure Computer Vision and a variety of different libraries in order to implement an object identification algorithm. 

##Goal
*Using a pre-trained model to make predictions, the code takes a set of images as an input, selects the ones containing bicycles and outlines the actual object.
*It is also able to calculate the error rate by determining the precision, accuracy and recall using mathematical formulas
